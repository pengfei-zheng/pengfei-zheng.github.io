# 1.Create a Github Pages repository.
## 1.1.Create a repository.

Head over to GitHub(https://github.com/) and create a new repository named username.github.io, where username is your username (or organization name) on GitHub.

If the first part of the repository doesn’t exactly match your username, it won’t work, so make sure to get it right.
